**People argue often.** This app aims to settle disputes fairly and effeciently by providing crowdsourced arbitration. Drawing on a classic _Q&A_-like interface and structure (think <http://stackoverflow.com>), **Gavel** will allow users to post arguments (allowing both vested parties to post their own recollection of events) and leave arbitration award and judgment to commenters. Judgments may be voted up or down, and at a specified threshold, an accepted verdict will be selected. The posters are asked to abide by the course of action set forth in the accepted verdict. Users with more accepted verdicts will be given tiered credentials and extended priveledges. ***One day***, premium accounts will offer verdicts from accredited professionals.
